Analysis of Cancer Drugs 

This study looked at cancer drugs and their effect on tumor size and mortality rates of mice over a 45 day period.  The data sets were manipulated using Panda's andsd then used to create a scatter plot of the information to find which one was most effective and had the least death rates. This included adding in the Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days was created and shows the results of each drug and their change in the volume over the study.

The graphs can be found in the png files Tumor Response Treatment, Survival Rate of Study, and Metastic Spreading During Study.
