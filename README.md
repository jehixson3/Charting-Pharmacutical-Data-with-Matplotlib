Analysis of Cancer Drugs 

This study looked at cancer drugs and their effect on tumor size and mortality rates of mice over a 45 day period.  The data sets were manipulated using Panda's to create unique dataframes that were used to create scatter plots of the information.  The questions answered included which drug was most effective, what the metastic growth looked like for each drug and which drug had the least death rates. 

A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days was created and shows the results of each drug and their change in the volume size over the study.

The graphs can be found in the png files Tumor Response Treatment, Metastic Spreading During Study, and Survival Rate of Study.

Additionally, an analysis of the study and recommendations for further studies are located in the Analysis.docx file.
